## 以下均为一些事实基础和试验的推断

git based on one princeple: ::commits can not be changed manually::

so, file comparing depends on *comparing commits* only commit hashes, not others

only one way can go back --- reset

1. pushed remote files keeps the commits order with the local files, totally same
2. when merging(including pulling), commits will check the commit time(which is according your local time), and order the commits based on the time 
3. 发现一个tag可能的疑惑点（也可以称为bug？）
